1. man -k "TheWordIAmInterestedIn"
   Discovery: I found it when I browse through the
   manual of man and further searched related 
   apropos and whatis commands
2. /bin/cp
   and
   /usr/bin/wc
   respectively.
   Discovery: I noticed that the slides of Josh
   gave us the hint of which, a command I later
   searched its manual. I used which cp and
   which wc to get the results. 
3. w [ X
   w: show who is logged on and what they are doing
   [: not included in manual
   X: a portable, network-transparent window system
   Discovery: viewing the man of find I got
   -executable and -name. I originally used
   find / -executable -name "?". However, this
   met with many denied access permission. I
   noticed from previous question that usually
   a name without a suffix is a kind of cmd.
   They locate in /usr/bin. Therefore I instead
   used the command
   find /user/bin -executable -name "?"
   and get the results.
4. /etc/alternatives/emacs
   Discovery: Josh's slides gave us the hint
   of readlink. Checking the manual of readlink,
   I used the command readlink /usr/bin/emacs 
   and get the result.
5. g+s means set group member ID upon execution which
   allows temporary visiting the documents of higher
   permission level.
   o-x means removing the executable permission
   for other people.
   Discovery: learned from the Josh's slides.
6. find -mtime -21
   Discovery: from the manual of find I noticed
   in the latter part it introduced the -atime,
   -ctime and -mtime along with the definition
   of +n, -n and n.
7. ./Desktop
   ./Desktop/desktp.ini
   ./Desktop/Google Chrome.lnk
   ./Documents/desktop.ini
   ./Downloads
   ./Downloads/desktio.ini
   ./Downloads/1.1.pptx
   ./Downloads/1.1(1).pptx
   ./.bash_history
   ./testDir
   ./.lesshst
   Discovery: follow question 6.
8. 358
   Discovery: Josh's slides gave the hint of wc.
   To achieve this, use the command
   which find
   to get the directory of find, which is /usr/bin
   use the command
   find /usr/bin -type -l | wc -l
   to print out the number of line for find.
9. sgmlwhich
   Discovery: after failed using find, I noticed
   that ls allows to print all directories and
   files in the sequence of time by using ls -tlt
   command. The last object of its output is the
   oldest file.
10. from LC_* environment variables.
    Discovery: this is mentioned in the Description
    section of man localdef.

    Discovery: Found this command from the GNU
    Emacs Reference card: C-h f and type "sort"
12. C-M-a: beginning-of-defun
    C-M-b: backward-sexp
    C-M-c: exit-recursive-edit
    C-M-d: down-list
    C-M-e: end-of-defun
    C-M-f: forward-sexp
    C-M-h: mark-defun
    Discovery: Use command C-h b to open the list
    of all keys. Use C-s to search for keys with
    the starting of "C-M" and view the descriptions.
13. C-g runs the command keyboard-quit, a Lisp function.
    It signals "quit" and leave the waiting-for-input
    condition aborted.
    Discorvery: Use command C-h k, then type in the
    command of C-g, which shows the detailed description.
    I have made simple revision of the official explanation.
14. yank reinsert or paste the most recently killed text
    to the place of cursor.
    Discorvery: similar to Q13, type C-h k and C-y to find
    the description.
15. dired command described at the beginning with the info
    of available space: "total used in directory 395152 
    available 10174588". However, ls -l only showed "total
    395056". Furthermore, dired allows us to access these
    files by moving the cursor and type Enter to edit in emacs.
    On the other hand, there is a space before 
    every entry. Also, dired listed some entry that are
    hidden when printed by the command ls -l. Meanwhile,
    some entries that has special color in ls -l is changed
    back to default in the dired command.
    Discovery: Use C-h-f to find the key for dired, which is
    C-x-d. Compare the results of Emacs' C-x-d with terminal's
    ls -l command results.
